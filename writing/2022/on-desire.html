        <p>I have heard that not wanting something is as good as having it.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I have also heard that wanting something bad enough is how you end up having it.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It appears as though it is the lukewarm wants that lie in between these two extremes that precisely cause suffering.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>While these wants are not strong enough to disturb the inertia of oneâ€™s life, they are not yet weak enough to be discarded. The result is a state of purgatory where one spends all of their time collecting more and more baggage without arriving anywhere.</p>
