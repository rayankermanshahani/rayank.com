        <p>There is science and then there is Science. The difference between them is that one does not require any belief, while the other demands it.</p>
        <br> 
        <br>
        <p>Science with a capital 's' is a dogmatic bastardization of science. It is destructive and it is antithetical to how humans make genuine scientific progress.</p> 
        <br> 
        <br>
        <p>Science with a capital 's' is what's being referred to when you hear someone exclaim something along the lines of “Trust the Science!” or “Believe in the Science!”.</p>
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <p>The believers of Science operate with the same caliber of religious zealots. They seek the comfort that comes with outsourcing the responsiblity of personal judgement, risk assessment, and decision making to some “higher” authority. It just so happens that God has recently gone out fashion (in most "developed" countries at least), so such people now find themselves worshipping at a new altar. The altar of experts and fact checkers. The altar of Science.</p>
